## Workflow Decision Points

### 1. Emergency vs Normal Registration
**Decision**: Is this an emergency patient?
- **Emergency**: Collect bed number and location
- **Normal**: Standard registration only

### 2. Prescription Creation
**Decision**: Is patient registered as emergency?
- **Emergency**: Create delivery task automatically
- **Normal**: Standard pharmacy notification only

### 3. Medicine Status Updates
**Decision**: Emergency delivery or normal pickup?
- **Emergency**: Mark as delivered when delivery completed
- **Normal**: Mark as sold when patient picks up

## Technical Implementation

The workflow is implemented using:
- **Firebase Firestore** for real-time data synchronization
- **React Components** for user interfaces
- **Event-driven Architecture** for workflow automation
- **Role-based Security Rules** for data access control

All decision points are automated based on patient registration data and prescription context.
