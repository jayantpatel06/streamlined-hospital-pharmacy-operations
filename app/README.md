# Hospital Management System

A comprehensive hospital management system built with React and Firebase that handles the complete patient medication workflow from registration to delivery.

## üè• Complete Medication Workflow

### 1. Patient Registration
- **Normal Registration**: Standard patient information
- **Emergency Registration**: Includes bed number and hospital location
- Data is automatically updated in Firebase and becomes visible to all authorized staff

### 2. Patient Login
- Patients can log in using credentials provided during registration
- First-time login requires password update for security

### 3. Doctor Prescription Process
- Doctor selects patient from registered patient list
- Chooses medicines from predefined database with categories:
  - Pain Relief, Antibiotics, Cardiovascular, Diabetes
  - Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, Mental Health
  - Emergency Medications, Vitamins/Supplements
- Each medicine is automatically marked as 'prescribed'
- Medicine added to patient's medicine list with status tracking

### 4. Pharmacy Notification System
- **Automatic notification** sent to pharmacy when prescription is created
- **Emergency vs Normal Decision Point**:
  - **Emergency**: High priority notification with bed number and location
  - **Normal**: Standard notification for regular processing

### 5. Emergency Workflow
- **Emergency patients** (registered with bed number and location):
  - Delivery task automatically created
  - Delivery person searches for medicine in pharmacy
  - Medicine delivered directly to patient's location (bed number)
  - Status updated to 'delivered' when complete

### 6. Normal Appointment Workflow
- **Regular patients**:
  - Pharmacy manually marks medicine as 'ready' online
  - Patient comes to pharmacy to collect medicine
  - Pharmacy marks medicine as 'sold' upon pickup

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
