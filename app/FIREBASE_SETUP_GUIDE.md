# Firebase Implementation Guide

This guide explains how we've integrated Firebase into the Hospital Management System, removing all mock data and making the app fully functional with real-time database operations.

## Components Updated

1. **AuthContext** - Enhanced with Firebase methods:
   - Added functions for appointments, prescriptions, medical records, and emergency slots
   - All user operations now connect to Firestore

2. **Dashboard** - Removed mock data:
   - Data now loads dynamically from Firestore collections
   - Stats calculate from real data counts

3. **PrescriptionManager**:
   - Now loads prescriptions from Firestore
   - Creates new prescriptions in real-time
   - Filters based on user role

4. **MedicalRecordsManager**:
   - Records now load from Firestore
   - Creates new records in Firestore
   - Role-based access control

5. **EmergencySlotManager**:
   - Emergency slots now load from Firestore
   - Status updates sync with Firestore
   - Wait times calculate based on actual timestamps

6. **AppointmentScheduler**:
   - Appointments now save to Firestore
   - Patient selection integrated with real patient data

## Data Models

### User
```
{
  uid: string,          // Firebase Auth UID

  licenseNumber: string
}
```

### Appointment
```
{
  appointmentId: string,
  patientId: string,
  patientName: string,
  doctorName: string,
  department: string,
  date: string,
  time: string,
  type: string,
  notes: string,
  status: string,       // 'Scheduled', 'Confirmed', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'
  createdAt: timestamp,
  createdBy: string,    // UID of user who created appointment
  createdByRole: string
}
```

### Prescription
```
{
  prescriptionId: string,
  prescriptionNumber: string,
  patientId: string,
  patientName: string,
  doctorId: string,
  doctorName: string,
  medications: [{
    name: string,
    dosage: string,
    quantity: string,
    duration: string
  }],
  instructions: string,
  createdAt: timestamp,
  status: string        // 'Active', 'Completed', 'Cancelled'
}
```

### MedicalRecord
```
{
  recordId: string,
  patientId: string,
  patientName: string,
  doctorId: string,
  doctorName: string,
  type: string,
  diagnosis: string,
  symptoms: string,
  treatment: string,
  notes: string,
  vitals: {
    bloodPressure: string,
    heartRate: string,
    temperature: string,
    weight: string,
    height: string
  },
  followUp: string,
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```

### EmergencySlot
```
{
  slotId: string,
  patientName: string,
  patientId: string,
  urgency: string,      // 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'
  complaint: string,
  notes: string,
  status: string,       // 'Waiting', 'In Treatment', 'Completed'
  createdAt: timestamp,
  createdBy: string,
  createdByName: string
}
```

### PharmacyOrder
```
{
  orderId: string,
  orderNumber: string,
  patientId: string,
  patientName: string,
  medications: [string],
  orderDate: timestamp,
  status: string,       // 'Pending', 'Processing', 'Ready', 'Completed'
  notes: string
}
```

## Firebase Security Rules

Important security rules have been implemented to ensure:

1. Only doctors can create medical records
2. Only doctors and pharmacy staff can create prescriptions
3. All staff can view patient data
4. Patients can only view their own data

## Next Steps

1. Test the application extensively with real data
2. Implement additional Firebase features like Cloud Functions for notifications
3. Add Firebase Storage for uploading medical images and documents
4. Implement real-time updates using Firestore onSnapshot listeners
