# PharmaFlow
This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of hospital pharmacy operations by implementing a comprehensive system that integrates inventory management, prescription processing, and medication dispensing.

## Features
This system streamlines **hospital pharmacy operations** with automation and real-time tracking to improve medication delivery and patient care.

### ðŸ”¹ Authentication & User Management
- Secure **user sign-in and authentication** via Firebase Auth.
- **Role-based access control** for hospital admin, receptionist, doctors, nurses, pharmacy staff, and patients.
- **Multi-app authentication support** for multiple Firebase instances.

### ðŸ”¹ Digital Prescription Processing
- **Doctors enter prescriptions digitally**, removing the need for handwritten notes.
- **Prescriptions are instantly sent to the pharmacy**, eliminating manual handovers.
- **Pharmacy staff receive real-time alerts** and prepare medications promptly.
- **Patients are notified** once their medicines are ready for pickup.
- **Emergency patients receive bedside delivery** as a priority service.

### ðŸ”¹ Pharmacy Notification & Workflow Automation
- **Automated prescription updates** ensure pharmacy staff stay informed.
- **Emergency medication alerts** allow faster response for critical patients.
- **Peak-Hour Nurse Assistance:**  
  - When the **pharmacy is overloaded during peak hours**, notifications are sent to all nurses within the hospital.
  - Nurses can **voluntarily accept** the request and assist pharmacy staff with preparation or delivery.
  - The system **tracks nurse contributions**, allowing for incentives or recognition.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
