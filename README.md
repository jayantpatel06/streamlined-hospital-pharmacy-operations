# PharmaFlow
This project aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of hospital pharmacy operations by implementing a comprehensive system that integrates inventory management, prescription processing, and medication dispensing.

## Features
This system streamlines **hospital pharmacy operations** with automation and real-time tracking to improve medication delivery and patient care.

### ðŸ”¹ Authentication & User Management
- Secure **user sign-in and authentication** via Firebase Auth.
- **Role-based access control** for hospital admin, receptionist, doctors, nurses, pharmacy staff, and patients.
- **Multi-app authentication support** for multiple Firebase instances.

### ðŸ”¹ Digital Prescription Processing
- **Doctors enter prescriptions digitally**, removing the need for handwritten notes.
- **Prescriptions are instantly sent to the pharmacy**, eliminating manual handovers.
- **Pharmacy staff receive real-time alerts** and prepare medications promptly.
- **Patients are notified** once their medicines are ready for pickup.
- **Emergency patients receive bedside delivery** as a priority service.

### ðŸ”¹ Pharmacy Notification & Workflow Automation
- **Automated prescription updates** ensure pharmacy staff stay informed.
- **Emergency medication alerts** allow faster response for critical patients.
- **Peak-Hour Nurse Assistance:**  
  - When the **pharmacy is overloaded during peak hours**, notifications are sent to all nurses within the hospital.
  - Nurses can **voluntarily accept** the request and assist pharmacy staff with preparation or delivery.
  - The system **tracks nurse contributions**, allowing for incentives or recognition.

## Technologies Used
This project leverages **modern web technologies** to provide a secure and scalable solution.

### ðŸ”¹ Backend
- **Node.js** â€“ Handles API requests and server-side logic.
- **Express.js** â€“ Lightweight framework for efficient routing and middleware.

### ðŸ”¹ Frontend
- **React.js** â€“ Dynamic user interface with fast rendering.
- **Redux** â€“ State management for seamless data flow.

### ðŸ”¹ Database & Authentication
- **MongoDB** â€“ NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage.
- **Firebase Auth** â€“ Secure authentication for user roles.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** â€“ Token-based security for authentication.

### ðŸ”¹ Deployment & Scalability
- **Docker** â€“ Containerized deployment for consistency across environments.
- **Kubernetes** â€“ Orchestrated scaling and management of services.

- Use the provided admin credentials to log in and manage pharmacy operations.  <br>

The following are the credentials of the registered hospitals:
i. To login as a hospitalA: (adminStaff) <br>
   Username: hospadmin@hospitala.com <br>
   Password: hospadmin@hospitala.com <br>
ii. To login as a hospitalC: (adminStaff) <br>
   Username: hospadmin@hospitalc.com <br>
   Password: hospadmin@hospitalc.com <br>

For detailed guidance on using the system, including hospital registration, staff management, patient operations, and pharmacy workflows, refer to the **[User Guide]** available on the top of Login Page.
